Assignment n. 4: MAPF

Project based on:
A Project on Multi-Agent Path Finding
Wolfgang HÃ¶nig, California Institute of Technology 
(formerly University of Southern California)
Jiaoyang Li, University of Southern California
Sven Koenig, University of Southern California 
http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2020/mapf/

Project requires Python3 and above.

On this project I focused on simple implementation of MAPF using A star path
finding and collision prevention with time-space domain constraining.

This project provides two solutions:

Naive solution with hand-made constraints for 2 agents on map exp2_1.txt.
A star path finding for agents on maps exp0.txt - exp4.txt.

Application provides dialogue console interface for choosing type of solutions.
Steps are shown on python animation provided by original project.

Start application in project folder with:
python run_experiments.py --instance instances/exp0.txt --solver Prioritized
exp0 represents map of your choice.
All maps are in ./instances folder.
